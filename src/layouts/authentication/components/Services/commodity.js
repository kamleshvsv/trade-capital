                <strong>Types of Commodities</strong> :
                 <br />
                 Commodities can be broadly categorized into four main groups: metals (such as gold, silver, copper), energy (including crude oil, natural gas), agriculture (such as wheat, corn, soybeans), and soft commodities (including coffee, cocoa, sugar). Each commodity has its own unique characteristics and is influenced by specific supply and demand factors.

                <strong>Physical and Derivatives Markets</strong> :
                 <br />
                 Commodity trading can occur in both physical and derivatives markets. In the physical market, actual delivery of the physical commodity takes place. However, most commodity trading occurs in derivatives markets, where contracts representing the underlying commodities are bought and sold. Derivatives contracts include futures, options, and swaps, providing traders with flexibility in their trading strategies.

                <strong>Price Volatility</strong> :
                 <br />
                 Commodity prices are often subject to significant volatility due to various factors, including weather conditions, geopolitical events, government policies, and global economic trends. The inherent volatility presents opportunities for traders to profit from price fluctuations but also increases the risk of potential losses.

            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Global Market Influences</strong> :
                 <br />
                 Commodity prices are influenced by both local and global market factors. Local factors include production levels, weather conditions, and government regulations in specific regions. Global factors include international demand and supply dynamics, currency exchange rates, and global economic trends. Traders analyze these factors to make informed trading decisions.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Hedging and Risk Management</strong> :
                 <br />
                 Commodity trading serves as a means for producers and consumers of commodities to hedge against price risk. Hedging involves taking offsetting positions in the futures or options markets to mitigate potential losses due to adverse price movements.
