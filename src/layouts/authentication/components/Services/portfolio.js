          <p>Portfolio management refers to the process of managing a collection of investments, known as a portfolio, with the objective of achieving the investor's financial goals while taking into account their risk tolerance. It involves strategic decision-making, ongoing monitoring, and adjustment of investments to optimize returns and manage risk.

                <strong>Asset Allocation</strong>:
                <br />
                Asset allocation is the process of distributing investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, cash, and alternative investments (e.g., real estate, commodities). The goal is to create a diversified portfolio that balances risk and return based on the investor's objectives and risk tolerance.

                <strong>Risk Assessment and Management</strong>:
                <br />
                Portfolio managers assess the risk profile of investors and tailor the portfolio accordingly. They consider factors such as investment horizon, financial goals, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs. Risk management involves strategies such as diversification, hedging, and implementing risk controls to protect the portfolio from adverse market movements.

                <strong>Investment Selection</strong>:
                <br />
                Portfolio managers select specific investments within each asset class to include in the portfolio. They analyze various factors, including the fundamental analysis of individual securities, historical performance, industry trends, and market conditions. The goal is to identify investments that align with the portfolio's objectives and have the potential to generate returns.

            <li>
                <strong>Rebalancing</strong>:
                <br />
                Portfolio managers regularly review and rebalance portfolios to maintain the desired asset allocation. Rebalancing involves adjusting the portfolio's holdings by buying or selling investments to restore the desired asset allocation percentages. This ensures that the portfolio remains aligned with the investor's risk tolerance and long-term goals.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Performance Monitoring</strong>:
                <br />
                Portfolio managers closely monitor the performance of the portfolio and its individual investments. They analyze returns, compare performance to relevant benchmarks, and assess the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Regular monitoring helps identify underperforming investments and opportunities for adjustments.
