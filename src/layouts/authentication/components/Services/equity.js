          Equity trading refers to the buying and selling of shares or stocks of publicly traded companies on stock exchanges. It is a key component of the broader financial market and provides individuals and institutions with the opportunity to invest in and trade ownership stakes in companies. Here are some key features of equity trading:

          <ul className="service-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Ownership in Companies</strong> : 
                <br />
                When individuals or institutions buy shares of a company's stock, they become partial owners of that company. The number of shares owned determines the percentage of ownership in the company. Equity traders aim to profit from changes in stock prices and may also benefit from dividends distributed by the company to shareholders.

                <strong>Stock Exchanges</strong> : 
                <br />
                Equity trading primarily takes place on stock exchanges, which are platforms where buyers and sellers trade stocks. Examples of well-known stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange (LSE), and Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). Stock exchanges provide a regulated marketplace with transparent pricing and facilitate efficient buying and selling of stocks.

                <strong>Liquidity</strong> : 
                <br />
                Equity markets are generally highly liquid, meaning there is a large number of buyers and sellers, enabling quick execution of trades. High liquidity allows traders to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting stock prices. Liquidity is influenced by factors such as the size of the company, trading volume, and market conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Long-Term Investment and Short-Term Trading</strong> : 
                <br />
                Equity trading caters to both long-term investors and short-term traders. Long-term investors typically focus on the fundamentals of a company, such as its financial health, growth potential, and management, with the intention of holding stocks for an extended period. Short-term traders, on the other hand, aim to profit from short-term price fluctuations and may employ technical analysis, charts, and trading strategies to make trading decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Market Orders and Limit Orders</strong> : 
                <br />
                Equity traders can place different types of orders to buy or sell stocks. A market order is an instruction to buy or sell a stock at the prevailing market price. It guarantees execution but does not specify the price. A limit order, on the other hand, allows traders to specify the maximum price they are willing to pay to buy or the minimum price they are willing to accept to sell. Limit orders provide control over the price but may not be immediately executed if the desired price is not met.
